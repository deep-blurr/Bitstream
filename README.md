# Bitstream
**Bitstream** is a command-line BitTorrent client built from scratch.  
The goal of this project is to deeply understand the BitTorrent protocol by implementing its components step by step, without relying on prebuilt libraries that abstract away the internals.  

## 🚀 Features (planned)

- ✅ Torrent metadata parsing   
- ✅ Peer discovery and handshake  
- 📡 Piece download and verification  
- 📁 File storage and management  
- ⚡ CLI interface for managing torrents
